### Hello, I'm Silvia 

Data scientist and mathematician, passionate about growth, learning and solving complex analytical problems. 

âœ¨ All data conceals a story, but how you tell the story is important âœ¨

Each data set is unique. I enjoy to unravel its insights via machine learning and deep learning techniques and then to tell its story through relevant visualizations.

I am mostly interested in working with unstructured text data and using the full spectrum of techniques from natural language processing to automatically extract and classify relevant information, answer questions or categorize documents.
