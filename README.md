### Hello :wave:

I am a data scientist, mathematician, researcher, coder, educator, data evangelist, hippophile, trail runner. I am passionate about growth, learning and solving complex analytical problems utilizing my extensive experience in higher education and research. 

I work with unstructured text data where I use the most advanced NLP techniques and the latest Deep Learning algorithms. I like to build knowledge graphs and I believe that graph data science brings into play specific powerful tools. By making use of the relations between the data points, it transforms the way we approach data and facilitates more accurate and easier to interpret predictions.
