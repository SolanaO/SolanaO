### Hello, I'm Silvia ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘©

Data scientist with mathematics background who is passionate about growth, learning and solving complex analytical problems. I love to work with big data and to tell its story with purposeful and interesting visualizations. I also enjoy explaining complex concepts using simple and meaningful examples.

Language is our main and one of the most powerful tools of communication, which can range from straightforward and simple to confusing and ambiguous. While I find the challenges that rise from the Language Technologies extremely interesting, my mathematics background gives me a deeper understanding of the algorithms and concepts used in these areas.

Solana's Github Pages is a collection of showcases for my data science and machine learning projects. I love working with data, I am a perpetual learner and I strive to share my knowledge. I am an avid mathematician with a keen interest in NLP and deep learning.   

## Recent Work and Work in Progress

- Presently I am working towards the Data Scientist Nanodegree with Udacity. 

- I analyzed the StackOverflow Developers Survey 2020 and wrote a short non-technical blog on Medium about my findings.

- Work in progress:

  > Build Disaster Response Pipelines with Figure Eight, a company focused on creating datasets for AI applications. I build a data pipeline to prepare message data from major natural disasters around the world and a machine learning pipeline to categorize emergency messages based on the needs communicated by the sender.
