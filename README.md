### Hello, I'm Silvia ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘©

Data scientist with mathematics background who is passionate about growth, learning and solving complex analytical problems. 

*All data conceals a story, but how you tell the story is important!* I enjoy working with data, unraveling its insights and telling its story via elegant and relevant visualizations. 

Language is our main and the most powerful tool of communication, it ranges from straightforward and simple to confusing and ambiguous. While I find the challenges that rise from the Language Technologies extremely interesting, my mathematics background gives me a deeper understanding of the algorithms and concepts used in these areas.
