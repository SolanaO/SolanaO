### Hello :wave:

☑️  I am a data scientist, mathematician, researcher, coder, educator, data evangelist, hippophile, trail runner. I am passionate about personal growth, continuous learning, and leverage my experience in academia and research to tackle complex analytical problems. 

☑️  Specialized in NLP with a current focus on large language models, I integrate advanced AI technologies to bring cutting-edge solutions to life.

☑️  With expertize in advanced graph analytics, I explore the integration of knowledge graphs with large language models. This fusion revolutionizes our interaction with data, and significantly elevates the quality of our insights derived from the data.
