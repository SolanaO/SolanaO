### Hello :wave:

I’m an AI/ML Architect 🤖 & Mathematician ∑ driven by curiosity and the pursuit of elegant, practical AI systems.  
I design and deploy intelligent architectures that connect structure, language, and meaning.  

☑️  Building and scaling solutions powered by Generative AI and Transformer architectures.  

☑️  Experienced in NLP across both research and production environments.  

☑️  Exploring the frontier between Knowledge Graphs and LLMs — expert in Graph Data Science.  

☑️  Applying a strong mathematical foundation to solve complex, real-world data challenges.  

Outside of tech, I’m a horse lover 🐴 and trail runner 🏃‍♀️, happiest where logic meets wilderness.
